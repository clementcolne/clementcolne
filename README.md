### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm ClÃ©ment ColnÃ© ! I'm a software engineering student, based in Nancy, France :fr:. I'm curently on my last year of studies, after what I'm going find a job as a software enginner, in an amazing compagny (I hope so :ghost:).

## About me :arrow_down:
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I have strong interest in stocks markets
- :coffee: I have an incurable coffee addiction
- :fork_and_knife: I enjoy cooking (and even more eating)
- :dog: Dogs are my best friends
- :sunglasses: I have 8 year expÃ©rience as a league of legends player and still gold, so I can promise you my mental is incredibly strong (or i'm a sociopath, I don't know :smiling_imp:)

I enjoy coding, especially create usefull tools. I mostly develop web projects, mainly in PHP (even if I get trashed for that :poop:) but I also like to use various technologies like other languages for backend like Java Spring Boot or frontend JavaScript frameworks like Vue.JS.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Angular](https://angular.io) and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
